===========================
Step 1: Code base cloning:
===========================

To clone the Git code base, please open a terminal/Git Bash for windows users, and run the following commands (skip the lines with # at the start):

# make a new directory:
mkdir git_reps

# go to that directory
cd git_reps

# "clone" the code from the Git repository
https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eo-lab/ocean.git

# you should now have a folder called "ocean".
# we are going to make and checkout your own local 'branch' of this code, so that you can track your changes against the downloaded code.
# To do this run the line below where <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME> should be something sensible that identifies the date, your name, and what 
# you are doing e.g. 20181121_ben_loveday_training_changes:

# go into the ocean
cd ocean

# and make a new branch of the code
git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>

# Now all the changes you make will be in your new branch, which means we can always 'roll back' to the old version if we make a mistake.

===========================
Step 2: Getting test data: 
===========================

To get the test data, you have two options:

Option 1: Windows (if you have Git bash)/Linux/OSx run the install_my_data.run script
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you open this code in a text editor (e.g. vi/gedit/notepad) you can see instructions on how to run this code.
It will automoatically download and install the data for you.

Please note, if you have not added Python to your path (through the non-default option during anaconda install, or adding to your bashrc),
you will need to do this for this code to work.

Option 2: Windows/Linux/OSx please download the zip files form the following directory:
--------------------------------------------------------------
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rcKBRdf_LtoKdTytYu5Ny102U0teoeZM

You can download this data to anywhere on your system, but please take a note of the path you downloaded it to.
Once downloaded, you will need to unzip the file.

===========================
Step 3: Running the test code: 
===========================

To run the code, we are going to use the Jupyter Notebook training Python training environment. 
To run this, open a terminal (Linux or OSX) or ANaconda Promt (windows) and type:

Jupyter-notebook

Note: You must make sure that you run Jupyter-notebook from a 'higher' directory level than where you installed the code (instructions above),
or it will not be able to see it.

Running the above command should open a browser window with the Jupiter environment pre-configured. 
Once Jupyter notebook has opened in a brower window, you should navigate
To check if you have all the required modules and data you need to navigate to the following code folder within your cloned Git repository:
'../../../git_reps/ocean/Configuration_Testing' folder.

Here, you can find, and run the Data_path_checker and Python_Configuration_Tester scripts.

If you follow the instructions in these scripts you can test check if your respective data and code and installed correctly.
If there are things missing, then these scripts will tell you. 

For this course, you need to make sure that all of the optional modules are also installed (see python installation section of Moodle).
